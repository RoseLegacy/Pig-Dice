    <h3>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.<br>
    If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.<br>
    If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</h3>
